# Qt-6-Core-Beginners-with-Cpp

Covering new material along with using CMAKE instead of QMAKE.   
Basic foundational concepts such as variables and each section move into more complex topics such as templates, classes, error handling, and how to use some of the Qt 6 classes included in the core library.   
Used C++ and Qt Creator which is the best IDE for developing cross-platform applications using Qt that can run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and embedded devices such as a Raspberry Pi, iPhone, and Android.
